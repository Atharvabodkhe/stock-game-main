# Fixing Game Room Visibility in Admin Dashboard

This guide will help you fix the issue where rooms disappear from the Game Rooms section in the Admin Dashboard after clicking the Start button.

## The Problem

When you start a game, the room disappears from the Game Rooms section, even though the game is still active. This happens because:

1. The Admin Dashboard only shows rooms that are:
   - Either have `status = 'open'` OR
   - Have `status = 'in_progress' AND all_players_completed = FALSE`

2. When you click the Start button, something is incorrectly setting `all_players_completed = TRUE`, making the room disappear.

## The Solution

We've created a two-part fix:

1. **Database Fix**: Ensures all in-progress rooms have the correct flags set
2. **UI Code Fix**: Adds safety mechanisms to the UI to ensure rooms stay visible

### Part 1: Applying the Database Fix

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy all contents from the `fix_room_visibility_complete.sql` file
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor and run it

This script:
- Fixes any existing rooms that should be visible but aren't
- Adds a database trigger to automatically keep rooms visible
- Creates a monitoring view to help identify visibility issues

### Part 2: Applying the UI Code Fix

We've made two small but crucial changes to the UI code:

1. **Enhanced startGame function**: Explicitly sets `all_players_completed = false` when starting a game
2. **Enhanced onMessage handler**: Adds a safety check to correct any room visibility issue in real-time

To apply these changes:

1. Open the `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` file
2. Find the `startGame` function (around line 550)
3. Make sure the `update` call includes `all_players_completed: false` like this:
   ```typescript
   const { error: roomError } = await supabase
     .from('game_rooms')
     .update({
       status: 'in_progress',
       started_at: new Date().toISOString(),
       all_players_completed: false // This line is crucial
     })
     .eq('id', roomId);
   ```

4. Find the `onMessage` handler (around line 130)
5. Add the visibility protection code right after the line checking for completed rooms:
   ```typescript
   // For rooms that should be visible in the Game Rooms section,
   // ensure all_players_completed is FALSE for room status 'preparing' or 'in_progress'
   if (newRecord.status === 'preparing' || newRecord.status === 'in_progress') {
     if (newRecord.all_players_completed === true) {
       console.log(`Room ${newRecord.id} has status ${newRecord.status} but all_players_completed is TRUE. Fixing locally to ensure visibility.`);
       newRecord.all_players_completed = false;
       
       // Also fix in database to ensure consistency
       (async () => {
         try {
           await supabase.from('game_rooms')
             .update({ all_players_completed: false })
             .eq('id', newRecord.id);
           console.log(`Fixed all_players_completed for room ${newRecord.id} in database`);
         } catch (error) {
           console.error(`Error fixing room ${newRecord.id} visibility in database:`, error);
         }
       })();
     }
   }
   ```

## Testing the Fix

After applying both fixes:

1. Create a new room in the Admin Dashboard
2. Add players to the room
3. Click the Start button
4. The room should remain visible in the Game Rooms section

## Why This Fix Works

The combined database and UI fixes ensure:

1. **Immediate Fix**: All existing rooms with incorrect visibility are fixed
2. **Proactive Prevention**: The database trigger prevents rooms from becoming invisible
3. **Real-time Protection**: The UI code fixes visibility issues as they occur
4. **Explicit Visibility Control**: The startGame function explicitly sets correct visibility

This solution doesn't change any existing functionality - it simply ensures that rooms with active games remain visible in the Admin Dashboard.
